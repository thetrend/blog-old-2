# hi again

I'm back on the internet. Let's see how long this lasts. I'm on an embarrassingly unknown iteration of my blog, yet again, but hopefully I'll stop fussing with it and just stick with something.

Today was a mixed bag of emotions. It was my first work-iversary, yay, but also one of my friends announced their notice. Then the queen died, but I also had a productive but sad, sad day. I was talking to a colleague tonight before book club and they said their spouse was really affected by the queen's passing. I honestly am, too... my dad's birthday was yesterday and my very first or second international trip as a child was to London. I have a lot of, of course, mixed emotions and memories of that trip, but I have my dad's photos of him exploring London and it just makes me sad to think about.

(If you're new around these parts, which, chances are you probably are, I talk about a lot of journeys: the Main Quest in life of course, mental health and grief -- my dad passed in 2021 -- and a bunch of other stuff. Baking, cooking. Art -- physical and digital. Snarky lil societal comments I should mostly keep to myself but will instead articulate in the form of memes. My social anxieties. Lots and lots of mental health. Web development! -- My fave. Learning. Teaching! Random little whatevers I find interesting. Cool articles to read.)

We tried [Factor_](https://go.factor75.com) recently. Honestly, it's a huge game-changer because we don't have time to cook dinner and still focus on eating healthy. **At the same time?!** *NONSENSE.* But no seriously, this subscription is a bit of a godsend since I'm trying to lose weight and master the goal of diabetes remission. We currently subscribe for 10 meals a week -- it's a weekly delivery -- which comes out to around $12 a pop. Throw it in the microwave for a few minutes and you're good to go? I'm IN! Hubby has been lovingly joking that he slaves over a hot microwave for 3 minutes and it's nice to know that we're freed a little bit more time-wise to do whatever we feel like. (Work. It's work. *I'm kidding. Mostly.*)

I'm just sitting here thinking about the next quarter's plans...
  * My nephew is turning 1!!! I'm so excited. Auntie Grace is baking his birthday cake and it's going to be amazing.
  * I'm hoping to continue on this downward trajectory of losing weight. I've lost around 10 lbs. so far but I'm hoping to lose a decent amount more before this time next year. **It's a bit of a surprise.**
  * I'm spending this quarter maintaining my reduction of sugar intake. I'm halfway to a diabetes remission! I know I can keep it up and hear those beautiful words in January.
  * I want to get more physically active. It's finally cooling down here in Gainesville and this will hopefully be the last quarter of emotional turbulence. It's been a rough year and I'm ready for it to come to a close.
  * I want to feel better about how I'm managing my mental health. With bumpy roads come bumpy rides but I'm sailing this boat and I know more or less how to navigate by myself.
  * Self Care 2022!!! I've struggled with this over the past ??? years, but with everything else I'm committed to, I'm happy to say I've gotten a good handle on this finally.
  * Hopefully a cozy November/December and holiday season! ðŸŽ„ With all the usual stuff going on year-end, Hubby and I also have our 9 year anniversary and our 4 year wedding anniversary. It's such a remarkable achievement-- at least it feels like it, anyway. I love celebrating the two of us, and it's only gonna get better from here.

Now that my blog is finally up, I'm going to stop playing around and actually crank out some cool apps.

One can hope.
